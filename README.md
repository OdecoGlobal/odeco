# 🌟 Okechukwu Chidera – Portfolio

Welcome to the source code for my personal portfolio website!  
This is where I showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a **Full-stack Developer**.

## 🚀 About the Project

I built this portfolio to not only introduce myself but also serve as a playground for modern web technologies.  
It highlights some of my favorite projects, my skillset, and how you can get in touch with me.

The goal was to create something:

- **Clean and minimal** – easy to navigate without distractions.
- **Responsive** – works beautifully on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Interactive** – smooth animations and components that feel alive.
